# Getting it right

## How we check data

We monitor API calls from all applications. We run automated tests to check data meets the requirements and is formatted correctly. In addition, we manually test data to make sure values are realistic and what we expect.

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
If your application passes our automated checks, you still need to fix any issues we find when we test it manually.
</div>

### What statuses mean

Missing, Invalid, Errors or Advisories header statuses mean you have issues to fix or review.

Correct header status means we have not found any issues this month, and your application currently meets the fraud prevention specification - not that your application is ‘compliant’.

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
Your header status is not to be shared outside your organisation.
</div>


## Check your application

You can now check your application’s fraud prevention headers on Developer Hub at any time.

To check your fraud prevention headers

1. Log in to Developer Hub
2. Go to View all applications
3. Select your Production application
4. On the left, select ‘Fraud prevention’

We no longer send detailed reports to you every month.

Now we send a monthly email telling you the status of your application, and what you need to do. The right people in your organisation need to receive the email - make sure they are all registered on HMRC’s Developer Hub.

Before you submit any header data, <a href="../test-api/#use-the-test-api">use the Test API</a>.

## Send data in the correct format

Header data contents must be submitted using the US-ASCII character set, with other characters <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> percent encoded (opens in a new tab)</a>.

Each header has additional formatting requirements. To check a header format, you need to <a href="../connection-method/">select your connection method</a>.


### Key-value encoding

Whenever a header contains a key-value data structure, you must use this format:

<code>&lt;key-1&gt;=&lt;value-1&gt;&amp;&lt;key-2&gt;=&lt;value-2&gt;&amp;&hellip;</code>

Whenever a key is applicable but has no applicable value, you can omit the key-value pair or include the key with an empty value.

Keys and values must be <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> percent encoded (opens in a new tab)</a>.

Key-value pairs can be submitted in any order.


### List encoding

Whenever a header contains a list, you must use this format:

<code>&lt;value-1&gt;,&lt;value-2&gt;,&hellip;</code>

Values must be <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> percent encoded (opens in a new tab)</a>.

Values must not be empty.


## Missing header data

<div class="govuk-warning-text">
  <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
  <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
    <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
    You are required by law to submit all header data for your connection method.
  </strong>
</div>

Most organisations are able to send all header data required for their connection method.

In exceptional cases you may be unable to collect a value due to restrictions beyond your reasonable control, such as:

* operating system or platform restrictions
* security measures

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
If you are unable to submit a header, you must <a href="#contact-us">contact us</a> to explain why. Make sure you include full details of the restrictions.
</div>

After discussing a missing header with us, you can omit the header or submit it with an empty value. You must not include a placeholder value, for example <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.

### Using third-party software and libraries

If you use or plan to use third-party software and libraries, make sure you can still collect header data. Examples include an extension to an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system or a plug-in to a spreadsheet application.

If you are explaining an exceptional case that means you cannot collect a value, include as many details as you can.
