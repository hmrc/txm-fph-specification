### Gov-Client-User-IDs

A key-value data structure containing user identifiers.

* The keys should indicate accounts the user holds

* Additional fields should contain the userâ€™s identifiers with the vendor services involved in the request.

<% if locals[:show_dynamic_content] %>
* The os field should contain the identifier of the user signed in on the originating device.

* Web applications do not usually provide the os field as browsers do not expose this information. If there is an os field, check your correct connection method.
<% end %>

* Every key and value must be percent encoded. Do not percent encode separators (equal signs and ampersands).
