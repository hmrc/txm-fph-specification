### Gov-Client-Device-ID

An identifier unique to the <a href="../#originating-device">originating device</a>.

* This should be generated by an application and persistently stored on the device

* The identifier should not expire

You can:

* generate an universally unique identifier (UUID), also known as a globally unique identifier (GUID), to use as a device ID

* store the device ID in a hidden file, the Windows registry, or in a cookie

The device ID will not be unique enough if you derive it from system or hardware properties, for example a disk serial number, MAC address, or network name.

If your end user deletes the device ID, we will not hold you responsible.

<strong>Example</strong>

<pre><code>Gov-Client-Device-ID: beec798b-b366-47fa-b1f8-92cede14a1ce</code></pre>
