### Gov-Client-Device-ID

An identifier unique to the <a href="../#originating-device">originating device</a>.

* You need to generate a universally unique identifier (UUID), also known as a globally unique identifier (GUID), to use as a device ID

* This should be generated by an application and persistently stored on the device. You can store the device ID in a hidden file, the Windows registry, or in a cookie.

* The identifier should not expire

* If your end user deletes the device ID, you need to generate a new one
