### Gov-Vendor-Public-IP

The public IP address of the servers the originating device sent their requests to.

* This could be an IP address of a Web Application Firewall (WAF), a DDoS Protection Service, or a load balancer that the vendor's DNS record resolves to.

* If the connection between client and server is over a private network, you will not be able to collect a public IP address. You need to check what to do about missing data.

<strong>Example</strong>

<pre><code>Gov-Vendor-Public-IP: 203.0.113.6</code></pre>
