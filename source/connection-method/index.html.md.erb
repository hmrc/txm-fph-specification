# What you need to send

The header data you need to send depends on your software architecture. We refer to your architecture as a connection method.

To find out what data you need to send, you must select your connection method. This depends on <a href="#direct-or-via-intermediary-servers">how your application connects</a> to HMRC and your <a href="#originating-device">originating device</a>.

## Select your connection method

<a href="desktop-app-direct/" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'On Page Navigation', 'Connection Method', 'Desktop application direct');">Desktop application direct</a><br>
Your application is installed on a desktop connecting directly to HMRC. Desktops include computers and laptops.</p>

<a href="desktop-app-via-server/" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'On Page Navigation', 'Connection Method', 'Desktop application via server');">Desktop application via server</a><br>
Your application is installed on a desktop connecting to HMRC through intermediary servers. Desktops include computers and laptops.

<a href="mobile-app-direct/" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'On Page Navigation', 'Connection Method', 'Mobile application direct');">Mobile application direct</a><br>
Your application is installed on a mobile device connecting directly to HMRC. Mobile devices include phones and tablets.

<a href="mobile-app-via-server/" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'On Page Navigation', 'Connection Method', 'Mobile application via server');">Mobile application via server</a><br>

<a href="web-app-via-server/" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'On Page Navigation', 'Connection Method', 'Web application via server');">Web application via server</a><br>
Your application is web based, connecting to HMRC through intermediary servers.

<a href="batch-process-direct/" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'On Page Navigation', 'Connection Method', 'Batch process direct');">Batch process direct</a><br>
Your application uses batch processes, connecting directly to HMRC.

### Direct or via intermediary servers

Your application connects directly to HMRC or via intermediary servers. Select a direct connection method if your application connects directly to HMRC.

If your application does not connect directly to HMRC, you need to select a server connection method. This refers to intermediary servers that are part of your application domain and are in your control. It does not include third-party servers such as transport layers or internet providers.

Where multiple services manage your intermediary servers, headers must contain data from all services.


### Originating device

Originating device means the device that initiates an action.

In most connection methods, it is usually the device that is physically in the possession of the person initiating the requests.

<p>In batch process direct, it might be a vendorâ€™s server.</p>

<p>In desktop application direct, or desktop application via server, it might be a hosted desktop environment accessed remotely by the user.</p>
