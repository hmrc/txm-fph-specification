# Fraud prevention

Version 2.9 issued 5 March 2020


## Why you must send data


We monitor transactions to help protect your customers' confidential data from criminals and fraudsters. To make this possible, you must send us specific types of user audit data.

Our APIs include HTTP fraud prevention headers so that you can submit the data we need. We use the data support prosecutions for tax or duty fraud.

You are required by law to submit header data for the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/vat-api/1.0">VAT (MTD) API</a>.

Soon, you'll need to send header data for all of our APIs. We recommend designing this into your applications now.
