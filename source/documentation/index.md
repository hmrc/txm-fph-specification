# Send data to prevent fraud

Version 2.9 issued 5 March 2020


## Why you must send data


We monitor transactions to help protect your customers' confidential data from criminals and fraudsters. To make this possible, you must send us specific types of user audit data.

Our APIs include HTTP fraud prevention headers so that you can easily submit the data we need.

The header data you send can influence the processing of the API call and supports prosecutions for tax or duty fraud.


### Your legal obligations

You are required by law to submit header data for the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/vat-api/1.0">VAT (MTD) API</a>.

Soon, you'll need to send header data for all of our APIs. We recommend designing this into your applications now.

If you need to review your privacy notices, you can <a href="/api-documentation/assets/content/documentation/3f4c263faa8231bea05c1826b7f6b81c-TxM DPIA v3 1 Public.pdf">check the data protection impact assessment</a>. You can also <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/360/made">check the regulations</a>.


### Using third-party software and libraries

If you use or plan to use third-party software and libraries, make sure you can still access header data. Examples include an extension to an ERP system or a plug-in to a spreadsheet application.

### Security

Transaction Monitoring (TxM) is a key security approach used in the UK and globally. Our approach is in line with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Cabinet Officeâ€™s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/271268/GPG_53_Transaction_Monitoring_issue_1-1_April_2013.pdf">recommended guidance</a>.
