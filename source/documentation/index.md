# Fraud prevention

Version 2.9 issued 5 March 2020


## Why you must send data

We monitor transactions to help protect your customers’ confidential data from criminals and fraudsters. To make this possible, you must send us specific types of user audit data.

When you use some of our APIs, you have to submit HTTP fraud prevention headers. We use the data to support prosecutions for tax and duty fraud.

You are required by law to submit header data for the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/vat-api/1.0">VAT (MTD) API</a>.

Soon, you'll need to send header data for all of our APIs. We recommend designing this into your applications now.


### Privacy and security

HMRC has the right to collect audit data. We follow best practices set out by the Information Commissioner’s Office.

Transaction monitoring is a key security approach used in the UK and globally. Our approach follows the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Cabinet Office’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/271268/GPG_53_Transaction_Monitoring_issue_1-1_April_2013.pdf">recommended guidance</a>.
