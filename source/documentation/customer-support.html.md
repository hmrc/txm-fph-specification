# Customer support model
<!--- Section owner: MTD Programme --->

We are developing a customer support model which will help guide businesses and agents to the most appropriate support. This may be provided by us at HMRC or you as a software vendor depending on the issue. Our HMRC support will be provided through a variety of channels and options for seeking advice and support.

We wish to work with you as software vendors to provide a comprehensive support package that covers software usage, online access and technical issues, as well as straightforward tax queries.

Businesses and agents will be signposted to self-help through a suite of guidance products such as videos, webinars and e-learning, which are aimed at specific stages of the MTD journey. We will develop the content as we add new functionality.

We have created a new dedicated team of advisers to offer telephone and webchat support for MTD. The team can currently be contacted via the [Get help using VAT online services](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-online-services-helpdesk) page. We will be developing new signposting on GOV.UK which will focus on digital and webchat support channels. This guidance will be updated as the model develops.
